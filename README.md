# Space_Invader_pygame
I learnt the pygame lib and tried my hands on it, here is the first product I developed. It's a very simple 90's video game inspired game, where no of space enemy come near our space ship and we shoot it one by one.

Used: pygame and math lib
	
  pyagme for all the visuals and the effects like sound, background image, space ship image the bullets etc
  
  math for the calculation for colliosion of bullet and the enemy
